This project shows my skillset such as: 
- data cleaning using Excel and VBA 
- creating measuers with DAX language 
- data visualisation and finalization report using Power BI.

Excel (.xlsm) files before and after data cleaning shows how those data was changed while data cleaning process. In this process I used methods of Excel and
created macros using Visual Basic for Applications. 

Power BI file (.pbix) shows the complete report. You can use "between slicers" and take a look how those data is changing while you are setting custom parameters.
Setting amount of appearances is important, because many polish players like juniors doesn't very play often and it is significant for comparision statistics 
such as "Polish players versus foreigners".

PDF file shows how report looks like on the first sight without downloading it, but you cannot make any interactions.
