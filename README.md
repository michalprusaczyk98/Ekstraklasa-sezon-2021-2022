This project includes: data cleaning with Excel and VBA | creating measuers with DAX | data visualisation and finishing report with Power BI

Excel (.xlsm) files before and after data cleaning shows how those data was changed while data cleaning processs. In this process I used methods of Excel and
created macros using Visual Basic for Applications. 

Power BI file (.pbix) shows the finished report. You can use "between slicers" and look how those data is changing while you are setting custom parameters.
Setting amount of appearances is important, because many polish players like juniors doesn't play and it is significant for comparising statistics 
such as "Polish players versus foreigners".

PDF file shows how report looks like on the first sight without downloading it, but you cannot make any interactions.
